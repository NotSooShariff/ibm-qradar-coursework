# Coursework Repository

Welcome to my coursework repository! This repository serves as a platform for submitting my coursework assignments while also offering an opportunity for anyone interested in exploring the world of cybersecurity tools and techniques. Feel free to check out the content, as it may provide valuable insights into various cybersecurity tools and methodologies commonly used in the field.

## 📃 Course Overview
In this course, I've been learning about various cybersecurity tools and techniques, with a focus on practical applications. The coursework has covered a wide range of topics, including but not limited to web penetration testing, systems hacking, and the usage of popular tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Mimikatz, and many more.

## 📚 Weekly Assignments Overview:

### Week 1: Web Penetration Testing
During the first week, we delved into the exciting world of web penetration testing. We explored the OWASP Top Ten, a list of the ten most critical web application security risks. Here are the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities:

- Broken Access Control
- Cryptographic Failures
- Injection
- Insecure Design
- Security Misconfiguration
- Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Identification and Authentication Failures
- Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Server-Side Request Forgery

For the assignment, I thoroughly investigated one CWE from each of these vulnerabilities, showcasing practical scenarios and countermeasures.

### Week 2: Systems Hacking with Kali Linux
In the second week of the course, we dived into systems hacking using the powerful Kali Linux distribution. The curriculum covered a wide array of topics, including:

- Information Gathering
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Web Application Analysis
- Database Assessment
- Password Attacks
- Wireless Attacks
- Reverse Engineering
- Exploitation Tools
- Sniffing Spoofing
- Post Exploitation

For the assignment, I delved into one tool from each category, demonstrating their usage and providing insights into how they can be employed for various security assessments and penetration testing tasks.

🔒 Happy hacking and stay secure! 🔐
